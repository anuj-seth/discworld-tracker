# discworld-tracker

The Discworld series has 41 novels and sometimes it becomes hard to remember which of the books I have already read.  
This tracker is a desktop application that shows the list of books alrady read/not read and allows books to be moved from one list to the other.  
It uses the wonderful halgari/fn-fx library, a functional wrapper for JavaFX.
