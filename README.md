# discworld-tracker

The Discworld series has 41 novels and sometimes it becomes hard to remember which of the books I have already read.  
This tracker is a desktop application that shows the list of books I have read and those I have not not read in two tables. Individual books can be moved from one list to the other.  
It uses the [fn-fx](https://github.com/fn-fx/fn-fx) library, a functional wrapper for JavaFX.
